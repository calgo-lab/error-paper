# Profiling of Runtime and Memory of `tab_err`

## Quickstart Guide (To get plots from the paper):

In the `profiling` directory do the following:

1. Generate profiling results: `poetry run -- python3 src/profile/profile_numeric.py` and `poetry run -- python3 src/profile/profile_string.py`

2. Aggregate memory results: `poetry run -- python3 src/aggregate_results/numeric_memray_results_allocation.py` and `poetry run -- python3 src/aggregate/string_memray_results_allocation.py`

3. Plot by running the notebook: `profile_paper_plots.ipynb`



## Description of Python Modules Used

Memory allocation results were obtained with a [memory profiling library](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/), `memray`.

Runtime results were obtained with the `time` module in python.


## Plots

The profiling plots used in the paper are available in the `plots` directory. They are generated by the `profile_paper_plots.ipynb` file.


## Comments on Hardware

Our results were obtained from the BHT Berlin compute cluster with 32000m CPU and 16Gb RAM used for each data type though only one process and one core was used per instance of runtime and memory profile. Further system specifications are in the paper.
