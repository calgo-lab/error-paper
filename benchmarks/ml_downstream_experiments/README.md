# Downstream Effect of Errors

This code corresponds to the downstream effect of `tab_err` on machine learning models from the paper. 

15 OpenML datasets are used in the experiments.

## To get results, per experiment

1. In `datasets` directory, run `python3 download_datasets.py`

2. In `generate_results`, run `python3 <experiment-name>.py`

3. Run notebook cells to obtain visualizations.

The results from our experiments are in the results directory.
